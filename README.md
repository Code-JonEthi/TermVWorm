### Terms Vs. Worms!
## A terminal PvZ-like game written in C++ (WIP)
right now it barely even displays anything in the window but I plan to turn this into
a full fledged, 10-level game.
supported on Linux and MacOS only (Or Windows on WSL).

### Installation Instructions
just run `g++ main.c -o TermVWorm`.
Then to play you can run `./TermVWorm`.

### How to play
Just figure it out until I decide to write the instructions.
